## **Core Features for MVP**

### **üìå Problem Input & Processing**

‚úÖ User types (or uploads) a math problem.  
‚úÖ The system first checks the Knowledge Graph to see if a solution already exists.  
‚úÖ If the problem is new, the **Solution Engine** interprets and solves it.  
‚úÖ If the problem exists in the database, the system retrieves the **precomputed step-by-step solution** and prerequisite concepts without additional computation.

---

### **üìå Solution Engine & Breakdown**

‚úÖ The **Solution Engine** solves the problem step-by-step if it is not found in the Knowledge Graph.  
‚úÖ Breaks the solution into prerequisite skills, mapping them to **"building blocks"** from the Knowledge Graph.  
‚úÖ Uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to interpret complex word problems and extract mathematical models.  
‚úÖ Generates a structured response, where each step:

- Explains **what to do in the step**
- Shows the **mathematical transformation**
- Links to a **foundational concept ("building block")**

---

### **üìå Knowledge Graph Implementation**

‚úÖ Maps relationships between mathematical concepts (e.g., equations, derivatives, optimization).  
‚úÖ Stores solutions & their step breakdowns for future retrieval.  
‚úÖ If a problem is already in the database, it returns the precomputed solution instead of calling the **Solution Engine**.  
‚úÖ If the **Solution Engine** generates a new solution, it is stored in the Knowledge Graph for future use.

---

### **üìå Guided Learning & Redirection**

‚úÖ Directs users to **explanations, exercises, and tools** needed for solving the problem.  
‚úÖ If a user struggles with a prerequisite skill, the system recommends **focused exercises** to strengthen that concept.  
‚úÖ Users can explore the **Knowledge Graph interactively** to understand how math concepts connect.

## **Use Cases**

### **Use Case 1: Problem Solving & Breakdown**

#### **Actors**

üë©‚Äçüéì **User (Student)**  
‚öôÔ∏è **Solution Engine**

- Solves problems **step-by-step** if no solution exists
- Breaks solutions into **fundamental math concepts ("building blocks")**

#### **User Story**

**As a Student:**

- I want to enter a math problem so the **Solution Engine** can explain how to solve it.
- I want to see which **foundational skills ("building blocks")** I need to improve.
- If the problem already exists, I want **instant retrieval** without unnecessary computation.
- If it's new, I want **step-by-step generated solutions**.
- If I struggle with a concept (building block), I want **related exercises** to strengthen my skills.

**As the Solution Engine:**

- I want to **first check the Knowledge Graph** for an existing solution before computing.
- If the problem is new, I want to **solve it step-by-step** and **break it down into prerequisite skills**.
- I want to **store new solutions** in the Knowledge Graph for future use.
- I want to **suggest related exercises** based on missing skills.
