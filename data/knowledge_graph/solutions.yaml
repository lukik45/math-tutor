        step_explanation: "Count the three-digit numbers with a digit sum of 4 by considering the hundreds digit."
        math_transformation: >
          If the hundreds digit is 1, then the remaining two digits must sum to 3, which has 4 solutions.
          If the hundreds digit is 2, then the remaining sum is 2, with 3 solutions.
          If the hundreds digit is 3, then the remaining sum is 1, with 2 solutions.
          If the hundreds digit is 4, then the remaining sum is 0, with 1 solution.
          Total count = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.

          For numbers starting with 1, the four solutions sum to 466.
          For numbers starting with 2, the three solutions sum to 633.
          For numbers starting with 3, the two solutions sum to 611.
          For numbers starting with 4, the one solution is 400.
          Total sum = 466 + 633 + 611 + 400 = 2110.

        math_transformation: >
          A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
          For 2110, the digit sum is 2+1+1+0 = 4.
          Since 4 is not divisible by 9, 2110 is not divisible by 9.
