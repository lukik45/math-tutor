      - id: "ST3"
        step_number: 3
        step_explanation: "For a linear function to have no zeroes, it must be parallel to the x-axis, meaning a = 0 and b ≠ 0."
        math_transformation: "For a linear function to have no zeroes, it must be neither increasing nor decreasing. Thus, a = (6m^2 - 12m) = 0 and b = -5 ≠ 0."
