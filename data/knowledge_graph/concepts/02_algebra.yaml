    example: "x, y, and z are typical variables."
    requires: ["Algebra"]

  - name: "Algebraic Expressions"
    description: "Combinations of numbers, variables, and operations that represent a value."
    example: "3x + 2 or 5a - 4b."
    requires: ["Algebra", "Variables"]

  - name: "Naming Algebraic Expressions"
    description: "The terminology used to describe parts of algebraic expressions, such as terms, coefficients, and constants."

  - name: "Negation of an Expression"
    description: "Applying a negative sign to an entire expression, effectively reversing the sign of each term."
    example: "-(x + y) = -x - y."
    requires: ["Algebraic Expressions"]

  # Equations and Their Solutions
  - name: "Equations"
    description: "Mathematical statements that assert the equality of two expressions."
    example: "2x + 3 = 7."
    requires: ["Algebraic Expressions", "Algebra"]

  - name: "Solving Equations"
    description: "The process of finding the value(s) of the variable(s) that satisfy an equation."
    example: "Solving 2x + 3 = 7 yields x = 2."
