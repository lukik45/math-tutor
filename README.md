# math-tutor


What:
The math tutoring and self-studying help platform


Why:
- Parents are willing to pay for their children education, but a student does not usually need the tutor all the time
- a student learns the best when solving the excercises on their own. When somebody starts solving for them, or even with them (as we tutors do), they start learning in a passive way - memorizing the steps to solve a particular exercise. 
- the "tools" or "building blocks" that are introduced on math lessons mixed with their usage, no clear way of showing the need of understanding the previously introduced building blocks
- Most students in the second or third year of high school have no problem with the current material but struggle to solve problems because they don’t remember how to factor out parentheses, how to solve equations—when it can be done and when it is useful, or how exponentiation works. This is very confusing for students because, during lessons, they try to memorize the solution pattern for a specific type of problem but don’t remember or notice that solving it requires fundamental building blocks.

How:
- showing the dependencies between the math topics and concepts. Decomposing math problems into "building blocks". 
- hierarchically showing the building blocks in a form of a graph. Suggesting the excercises to polish the basic tools
